Description  : "Coding Chronicles: The Evolution of Angular - A Frontend Developer’s Journey from AngularJS to Modern Angular"
---

Once upon a time, in the vast world of web development, there was a tool that promised to bring structure and efficiency to the chaotic realm of JavaScript. This tool was AngularJS, the first version of the Angular framework. As a young developer setting foot into the industry, I witnessed the birth of AngularJS and its transformative impact on frontend development.



### Chapter 1: AngularJS (1.x) — The Pioneer

AngularJS emerged in 2010, introducing the concept of two-way data binding. This meant that changes in the user interface instantly reflected in the application logic and vice versa. It was a game-changer, making dynamic web applications more manageable. But as projects grew larger, AngularJS revealed its limitations. The framework lacked modularity and suffered from performance issues.


### Chapter 2: Angular 2 — The Rebirth

In 2016, a major overhaul occurred with the release of Angular 2. The framework was rewritten from scratch, embracing TypeScript and introducing a component-based architecture. This shift allowed for greater modularity and scalability. Developers had to bid farewell to controllers and embrace a more declarative approach for building components. The introduction of the Angular CLI simplified project setup and maintenance.

### Chapter 3: Angular 4/5/6 — The Streamlined Journey

The framework’s developers decided to skip version 3 and instead directly release version 4.0. So Angular continued to evolve rapidly, with versions 4, 5, and 6 introducing incremental improvements and optimizations. The Angular team adopted Semantic Versioning, promising backward compatibility with each update. These versions focused on reducing bundle sizes, enhancing the Angular CLI, and improving the overall developer experience.

### Chapter 4: Angular 7/8 — The Ivy Revolution

In 2018, Angular 7 arrived with a significant performance boost and new features. However, it was Angular 8 that laid the foundation for the revolutionary Ivy renderer. Ivy was a complete rewrite of the Angular rendering engine, promising smaller bundle sizes, faster compilation, and improved tree-shaking. It was a game-changer, making Angular applications more efficient and responsive.

### Chapter 5: Angular 9/10/11 — The Maturation Process

The subsequent versions of Angular focused on refining the framework. Angular 9 introduced the Ivy compiler as the default, bringing smaller bundle sizes and improved developer tooling. Version 10 focused on performance enhancements while Angular 11 brought stricter types, improved debugging and better styling support.

### Chapter 6: Angular 12/13/14 — Keeping Pace

Angular continued its steady evolution, with versions 12, 13, and 14 introducing updates to the Angular CLI, improvements in the Ivy engine, and enhanced developer tooling. The community grew stronger, and Angular became a reliable choice for building large-scale applications.

### Chapter 7: Angular 15/16 — Navigating Maturity

As the Angular framework continued its evolutionary journey, versions 15 and 16 marked a pivotal phase in its development. Angular 15 brought forth refinements to the Ivy renderer, further optimizing performance and addressing compatibility issues. The Angular team focused on fine-tuning the developer experience, streamlining workflows, and introducing enhancements to the Angular Material library. Developers found themselves navigating a landscape of improved tooling and a more mature ecosystem.



-----------------------

In Angular 16, the community witnessed a concerted effort to modernize the framework. The Angular CLI received updates to align with the latest industry standards, and the Ivy renderer continued to evolve, promising even more efficient bundle sizes and faster rendering. The Angular team embraced the latest JavaScript features, making it easier for developers to write clean and concise code.

With versions 15 and 16, Angular solidified its position as a reliable choice for building sophisticated applications. The framework’s commitment to stability, performance, and a thriving community underscored its importance in the rapidly evolving world of web development.


### Chapter 8: Angular 17/18 — The Modernization Culmination

In the ever-changing landscape of frontend development, Angular 18 emerged as the culmination of a journey marked by continuous improvement and innovation. This version of the framework brought with it a renewed focus on modernization, reinforcing Angular’s standing as a powerhouse for building robust web applications.

Angular 18 prioritized simplicity and performance, introducing enhancements that significantly improved the developer experience. The Angular team embraced the latest ECMAScript features, delivered unparalleled efficiency in terms of bundle sizes and rendering speed.

A part of these, Angular introduced a lot of new changes, a new logo and a new documentation page for developers: [https://angular.dev/](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fangular%2Edev%2F&urlhash=8JI9&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block). So this seems like a second revolution about the framework. Regarding these new features we can found the introduction of a declarative control flow mechanism marks a paradigm shift in how we manage templates.

Another important thing that has been requested for some time is the lazy loading of specific elements or complete components. In this Angular version has been introduced the Deferred Loading Block mechanism. Indeed, now defer can be used to delay the loading of components in response to different user interactions (mouse over, click and so on).

Another important thing that was introduced with Angular 16 and keept in 17 and 18 were Signals are a new feature that tracks changes in a variable’s value and notifies us reactively when a change occurs. According to the Angular documentation, signals provides “a system that granularly tracks how and where your state is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize rendering updates”. In other words, it’s a way to manage state in the application in a way that allows Angular to react to changes in the most effective way possible.

## Version History

Last but not least, Angular with these versions introduced also standalone. Standalone Components, which are one of the most interesting innovations in the Angular ecosystem in recent years trying to simplify the organization of an Angular project for new joiners without modules. These are just some of relevant news introduced with the modern Angular but we could go forward with introduction of Server Side Rendering SSR on the architectural point of view. The Angular team with these versions trying to extend, simplify and improve the performance of the framework (embracing Signal instead of RxJS for simple use cases) and definitely trying to substitute some external libraries.

And so, the story of Angular continues with each chapter unveiling new possibilities and setting the stage for the future of frontend development. I think that we have another revolution with the modern Angular (an Angular 3.0) with the aim of returning to the top of the most used frontend frameworks.

### Tips: Upgrade Angular version

Some steps are typically required when updating to a new major version of Angular. You may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs. The Angular website includes an interactive [Angular Update Guide](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupdate%2Eangular%2Eio%2F&urlhash=rRf1&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) that lets you input your project specifics, and then produces a detailed list of instructions.
