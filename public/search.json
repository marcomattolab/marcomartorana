[{"content":"In the world of project management, effectively managing priorities is crucial for the success of any project.\nWhether launching a new software product, implementing a marketing campaign, or coordinating a large corporate initiative, knowing how to correctly set priorities can make the difference between success and failure.\nIn this article, we will explore some fundamental guidelines for managing project priorities, based on key project management principles.\nDefine Key Project Objectives\nFirst and foremost, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the project’s objectives. This means knowing exactly what you want to achieve, the expected outcomes, and how these contribute to the organization’s strategic goals.\nObjectives should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\nOnce these objectives are established, it will be easier to align priorities and ensure that every activity contributes to achieving these goals.\nEvaluate and Classify Activities\nOnce objectives are defined, it’s necessary to list all the activities required to achieve them. This step involves a detailed breakdown of the project into specific tasks. Subsequently, each activity must be evaluated and classified based on its importance and urgency. A useful method for this is the Eisenhower Matrix, which divides tasks into four categories:\nImportant and Urgent: To be done immediately. Important but Not Urgent: To be scheduled. Not Important but Urgent: To be delegated. Not Important and Not Urgent: To be eliminated. Create a Detailed Project Plan\nWith a list of prioritized activities, the next step is to create a detailed project plan. This plan should include timelines, required resources, and the roles and responsibilities of team members.\nTools like Gantt charts or project management software (e.g., Trello, or Microsoft Project) can be extremely useful for visualizing and tracking project progress.\nAllocate Resources Strategically\nResource management is a key element in priority management. It’s crucial to ensure that resources – both human and material – are allocated effectively. This means assigning the right resources to the right tasks at the right time, avoiding work overloads and bottlenecks. Resource management should be flexible to adapt to changes and emergencies that may arise during the project.\nMonitor and Reevaluate Priorities\nTask priorities can change over the course of the project. Therefore, it’s important to continuously monitor progress and be ready to reevaluate and reorganize priorities based on new information or changes in the project context.\nRegular update meetings and project status reviews are essential to keep the team aligned and to make necessary adjustments.\nEffective Communication\nClear and continuous communication is vital for managing priorities. All team members need to be aware of the project’s priorities and how their individual tasks fit into the overall picture.\nUsing internal communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams and holding regular meetings can help ensure that everyone is informed and aligned.\nManage Stakeholder Expectations\nIt’s essential to manage stakeholder expectations. This includes not only informing stakeholders about project progress but also ensuring they are aware of priorities and any changes.\nProactive management of expectations can prevent misunderstandings and ensure continuous stakeholder support throughout the project lifecycle.\nTechniques for Individual Priority Management More specifically I describe below techniques for individual priority management used ideally in the daily work-life not only by a project manager.\nEisenhower Matrix The Eisenhower Matrix used for deciding what to do and when to do it, it has been described above but here we divided the same four tasks into diverse categories to focus on the appropriate action.\nImportant and Urgent: Do it immediately. Important but Not Urgent: Schedule it. Not Important but Urgent: Delegate it. Not Important and Not Urgent: Eliminate it. This technique helps focus on tasks that truly matter, minimizing distractions.\n2. 3–3–3 Method\nProposed by Oliver Burkeman, this method involves planning the day to include:\n3 hours of deep work on an important project. 3 urgent tasks like crucial meetings, emails, and to-dos. 3 maintenance tasks for a smoother life. This approach balances the need for deep concentration and the management of daily tasks.\n3. Time Blocking\nSuggested by Cal Newport and Nir Eyal, Time Blocking involves:\nDividing your calendar into specific time blocks. Scheduling specific tasks within these blocks. Focusing only on one task during the assigned block. Techniques for Team Priority Management\nABCDE Method This method suggests classifying team tasks based on the consequences of not doing them:\nA: Highest priority, severe consequences if not done. B: Important but minor consequences. C: Nice to do, no consequences if undone. D: Delegate if possible. E: Eliminate entirely. This approach ensures that critical tasks receive the necessary attention.\n2. MoSCoW Method\nThe MoSCoW method categorizes tasks into:\nMust Have: Crucial for success. Should Have: Important but not vital. Could Have: Nice to have but not essential. Won’t Have: Out of scope. This technique helps focus resources on essential tasks for the project.\n3. Kanban Board\nKanban is a visual method for managing workflow. It involves organizing tasks into three columns:\nTo Do Doing Done This visualization facilitates prioritization coordination and enhances team collaboration.\nTechniques for Leadership Priority Management\nWarren Buffett 25/5 Rule Warren Buffett suggests:\nMaking a list of your top 25 initiatives.\nRanking them by importance. Focusing on the top 5. Ignoring the rest. This method ensures that attention is dedicated to the most important initiatives.\n2. Pareto Principle\nThe Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, indicates that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.\nBy identifying and focusing on this 20%, leaders can maximize impact with less effort.\n3. Theory of Constraints\nThis theory involves:\nIdentifying system constraints. Optimizing them. Synchronizing the rest of the system around these constraints. For continuous improvement it is recommended to repeat this process to achieve new better results.\nConclusion Setting and managing priorities effectively is a crucial skill not only for a project manager but also for each team member. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that resources are used optimally, critical tasks are addressed promptly, and the project progresses smoothly towards achieving its objectives.\nThe key is to maintain a flexible approach, communicate clearly, and continuously monitor progress, adapting to changes and new challenges along the way.\n","description":"How to Manage Priorities in Project Management: Essential Guidelines","tags":["project-management"],"title":"How to Manage Priorities in Project Management","uri":"/post/2020/jan/pmp-priority/"},{"content":"Once upon a time, in the vast world of web development, there was a tool that promised to bring structure and efficiency to the chaotic realm of JavaScript. This tool was AngularJS, the first version of the Angular framework. As a young developer setting foot into the industry, I witnessed the birth of AngularJS and its transformative impact on frontend development.\nChapter 1: AngularJS (1.x) — The Pioneer AngularJS emerged in 2010, introducing the concept of two-way data binding. This meant that changes in the user interface instantly reflected in the application logic and vice versa. It was a game-changer, making dynamic web applications more manageable. But as projects grew larger, AngularJS revealed its limitations. The framework lacked modularity and suffered from performance issues.\nChapter 2: Angular 2 — The Rebirth In 2016, a major overhaul occurred with the release of Angular 2. The framework was rewritten from scratch, embracing TypeScript and introducing a component-based architecture. This shift allowed for greater modularity and scalability. Developers had to bid farewell to controllers and embrace a more declarative approach for building components. The introduction of the Angular CLI simplified project setup and maintenance.\nChapter 3: Angular 4/5/6 — The Streamlined Journey The framework’s developers decided to skip version 3 and instead directly release version 4.0. So Angular continued to evolve rapidly, with versions 4, 5, and 6 introducing incremental improvements and optimizations. The Angular team adopted Semantic Versioning, promising backward compatibility with each update. These versions focused on reducing bundle sizes, enhancing the Angular CLI, and improving the overall developer experience.\nChapter 4: Angular 7/8 — The Ivy Revolution In 2018, Angular 7 arrived with a significant performance boost and new features. However, it was Angular 8 that laid the foundation for the revolutionary Ivy renderer. Ivy was a complete rewrite of the Angular rendering engine, promising smaller bundle sizes, faster compilation, and improved tree-shaking. It was a game-changer, making Angular applications more efficient and responsive.\nChapter 5: Angular 9/10/11 — The Maturation Process The subsequent versions of Angular focused on refining the framework. Angular 9 introduced the Ivy compiler as the default, bringing smaller bundle sizes and improved developer tooling. Version 10 focused on performance enhancements while Angular 11 brought stricter types, improved debugging and better styling support.\nChapter 6: Angular 12/13/14 — Keeping Pace Angular continued its steady evolution, with versions 12, 13, and 14 introducing updates to the Angular CLI, improvements in the Ivy engine, and enhanced developer tooling. The community grew stronger, and Angular became a reliable choice for building large-scale applications.\nChapter 7: Angular 15/16 — Navigating Maturity As the Angular framework continued its evolutionary journey, versions 15 and 16 marked a pivotal phase in its development. Angular 15 brought forth refinements to the Ivy renderer, further optimizing performance and addressing compatibility issues. The Angular team focused on fine-tuning the developer experience, streamlining workflows, and introducing enhancements to the Angular Material library. Developers found themselves navigating a landscape of improved tooling and a more mature ecosystem.\nIn Angular 16, the community witnessed a concerted effort to modernize the framework. The Angular CLI received updates to align with the latest industry standards, and the Ivy renderer continued to evolve, promising even more efficient bundle sizes and faster rendering. The Angular team embraced the latest JavaScript features, making it easier for developers to write clean and concise code.\nWith versions 15 and 16, Angular solidified its position as a reliable choice for building sophisticated applications. The framework’s commitment to stability, performance, and a thriving community underscored its importance in the rapidly evolving world of web development.\nChapter 8: Angular 17/18 — The Modernization Culmination In the ever-changing landscape of frontend development, Angular 18 emerged as the culmination of a journey marked by continuous improvement and innovation. This version of the framework brought with it a renewed focus on modernization, reinforcing Angular’s standing as a powerhouse for building robust web applications.\nAngular 18 prioritized simplicity and performance, introducing enhancements that significantly improved the developer experience. The Angular team embraced the latest ECMAScript features, delivered unparalleled efficiency in terms of bundle sizes and rendering speed.\nA part of these, Angular introduced a lot of new changes, a new logo and a new documentation page for developers: https://angular.dev/. So this seems like a second revolution about the framework. Regarding these new features we can found the introduction of a declarative control flow mechanism marks a paradigm shift in how we manage templates.\nAnother important thing that has been requested for some time is the lazy loading of specific elements or complete components. In this Angular version has been introduced the Deferred Loading Block mechanism. Indeed, now defer can be used to delay the loading of components in response to different user interactions (mouse over, click and so on).\nAnother important thing that was introduced with Angular 16 and keept in 17 and 18 were Signals are a new feature that tracks changes in a variable’s value and notifies us reactively when a change occurs. According to the Angular documentation, signals provides “a system that granularly tracks how and where your state is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize rendering updates”. In other words, it’s a way to manage state in the application in a way that allows Angular to react to changes in the most effective way possible.\nVersion History Last but not least, Angular with these versions introduced also standalone. Standalone Components, which are one of the most interesting innovations in the Angular ecosystem in recent years trying to simplify the organization of an Angular project for new joiners without modules. These are just some of relevant news introduced with the modern Angular but we could go forward with introduction of Server Side Rendering SSR on the architectural point of view. The Angular team with these versions trying to extend, simplify and improve the performance of the framework (embracing Signal instead of RxJS for simple use cases) and definitely trying to substitute some external libraries.\nAnd so, the story of Angular continues with each chapter unveiling new possibilities and setting the stage for the future of frontend development. I think that we have another revolution with the modern Angular (an Angular 3.0) with the aim of returning to the top of the most used frontend frameworks.\nTips: Upgrade Angular version Some steps are typically required when updating to a new major version of Angular. You may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs. The Angular website includes an interactive Angular Update Guide that lets you input your project specifics, and then produces a detailed list of instructions.\n","description":"Coding Chronicles: The Evolution of Angular - A Frontend Developer’s Journey from AngularJS to Modern Angular","tags":["evolution-of-angular"],"title":"The Evolution of Angular","uri":"/post/2020/jan/evolution-of-angular/"},{"content":"Articles about learn in public, brag document and free stuffs.\nLearn In Public If there’s a golden rule, it’s this one, so I put it first.

Would that be enough time for you to sufficiently capture some of the things you’re most proud of from the past few months or years?\nLink\nThe most successful developers share more than they take One of the questions I always ask successful bloggers is: what motivated you to start? The answer is always the same: I did it for myself. Whatever your work, you should embrace the philosophy of “public by default”.\nPublic-by-default means this: everytime you create something, learn something, or just notice something’s interesting, do it in public. This may seem daunting—writing blog posts, helping the community and transforming ideas from thoughts into words all takes time. But sharing is like a muscle, and by committing to a regular schedule, you become much more efficient. This consistency of volume is also key to reaping the benefits of sharing.\nTo truly embrace public-by-default, it’s not enough to share your successful projects and knowledge, but additionally to bring the humility to share your learning and failures.\nLink\n","description":"Articles about learning in public, brag document and free stuffs.","tags":["newsletter"],"title":"Collections No.6","uri":"/collections/2023/collections6/"},{"content":"After downloding the theme, uzip the file and go to the ’lightbi-hugo-master’ folder.

Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.\nUsing Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that.
