Description  : "How to Manage Priorities in Project Management: Essential Guidelines"
---
In the world of _project management_, effectively **_managing priorities_** is crucial for the **success** of any project.

Whether launching a new software product, implementing a marketing campaign, or coordinating a large corporate initiative, knowing how to correctly set priorities can make the difference between **_success_** and **_failure_**.

In this article, we will explore some fundamental guidelines for managing project priorities, based on _key project management principles_.

**Define Key Project Objectives**

First and foremost, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the project’s objectives. This means knowing exactly what you want to achieve, the expected outcomes, and how these contribute to the organization’s strategic goals.

> Objectives should be **SMART**: _Specific_, _Measurable_, _Achievable_, _Realistic_, and _Time-bound_.

Once these objectives are established, it will be easier to align priorities and ensure that every activity contributes to achieving these goals.

**Evaluate and Classify Activities**

Once _objectives_ are defined, it’s necessary to **list all the activities** required to achieve them. This step involves a detailed **_breakdown_** of the _project_ into specific tasks. Subsequently, each activity must be evaluated and classified based on its **_importance_** and **_urgency_**. A useful method for this is the _Eisenhower Matrix_, which divides tasks into four categories:

*   **Important** and **Urgent**: To be done immediately.
*   **Important** but _Not Urgent_: To be scheduled.
*   _Not Important_ but **Urgent**: To be delegated.
*   _Not Important_ and _Not Urgent_: To be eliminated.

**Create a Detailed Project Plan**

With a list of prioritized activities, the next step is to create a detailed project plan. This plan should include **timelines**, **required resources**, and the _roles and responsibilities of team members_.

> Tools like Gantt charts or project management software (e.g., Trello, or Microsoft Project) can be extremely useful for visualizing and tracking project progress.

**Allocate Resources Strategically**

Resource management is a key element in priority management. It’s crucial to ensure that resources – both human and material – are allocated effectively. This means assigning the right resources to the right tasks at the right time, avoiding work overloads and bottlenecks. Resource management should be flexible to adapt to changes and emergencies that may arise during the project.

**Monitor and Reevaluate Priorities**

Task priorities can change over the course of the project. Therefore, it’s important to continuously monitor progress and be ready to reevaluate and reorganize priorities based on new information or changes in the project context.

> Regular update meetings and project status reviews are essential to keep the team aligned and to make necessary adjustments.

**Effective Communication**

_Clear and continuous communication_ is vital for managing priorities. All team members need to be **aware** of the project’s _priorities_ and **_how_** their individual tasks fit into the overall picture.

> Using internal communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams and holding regular meetings can help ensure that everyone is informed and aligned.

**Manage Stakeholder Expectations**

It’s essential to manage **_stakeholder expectations_**. This includes not only informing stakeholders about project progress but also ensuring they are aware of priorities and any changes.

> Proactive management of expectations can prevent misunderstandings and ensure continuous stakeholder support throughout the project lifecycle.


# Techniques for Individual Priority Management

More specifically I describe below techniques for individual priority management used ideally in the daily work-life not only by a project manager.

![How to set priority!?](/marcomattolab/marcomartorana/img/posts/pmp-priority-01.png)


1.  **Eisenhower Matrix**

The **Eisenhower Matrix** used for deciding what to do and when to do it, it has been described above but here we divided the same four tasks into diverse categories to focus on the appropriate action.

*   Important and Urgent: **Do it immediately**.
*   Important but Not Urgent: **_Schedule it._**
*   Not Important but Urgent: _Delegate it._
*   Not Important and Not Urgent: _Eliminate it._

> This technique helps focus on tasks that truly matter, minimizing distractions.

**2\. 3–3–3 Method**

Proposed by Oliver Burkeman, this method involves planning the day to include:

*   3 hours of deep work on an important project.
*   3 urgent tasks like crucial meetings, emails, and to-dos.
*   3 maintenance tasks for a smoother life.

> This approach balances the need for deep concentration and the management of daily tasks.

3\. **Time Blocking**

Suggested by Cal Newport and Nir Eyal, Time Blocking involves:

*   Dividing your calendar into specific time blocks.
*   Scheduling specific tasks within these blocks.
*   Focusing only on one task during the assigned block.

**Techniques for Team Priority Management**

1.  **ABCDE Method**

This method suggests classifying team tasks based on the consequences of not doing them:

*   A: Highest priority, severe consequences if not done.
*   B: Important but minor consequences.
*   C: Nice to do, no consequences if undone.
*   D: Delegate if possible.
*   E: Eliminate entirely.

> This approach ensures that critical tasks receive the necessary attention.

2\. **MoSCoW Method**

The **MoSCoW** method categorizes tasks into:

*   Must Have: Crucial for success.
*   Should Have: Important but not vital.
*   Could Have: Nice to have but not essential.
*   Won’t Have: Out of scope.

> This technique helps focus resources on essential tasks for the project.

3\. **Kanban Board**

Kanban is a visual method for managing workflow. It involves organizing tasks into three columns:

*   To Do
*   Doing
*   Done

> This visualization facilitates prioritization coordination and enhances team collaboration.

**Techniques for Leadership Priority Management**

1.  **Warren Buffett 25/5 Rule**

Warren Buffett suggests:

Making a list of your top 25 initiatives.

*   _Ranking them by importance._
*   _Focusing on the top 5._
*   _Ignoring the rest._

> This method ensures that attention is dedicated to the most important initiatives.

**2\. Pareto Principle**

The **Pareto Principle**, or the _80/20 rule_, indicates that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.

> By identifying and focusing on this 20%, leaders can maximize impact with less effort.

**3\. Theory of Constraints**

This theory involves:

*   Identifying system constraints.
*   Optimizing them.
*   Synchronizing the rest of the system around these constraints.

> For continuous improvement it is recommended to repeat this process to achieve new better results.

# Conclusion

Setting and managing priorities effectively is a crucial skill not only for a project manager but also for each team member. By following these **_guidelines_**, you can ensure that resources are used optimally, critical tasks are addressed promptly, and the project progresses smoothly towards achieving its objectives.

The key is to maintain a **flexible approach**, **communicate clearly**, and **continuously monitor progress**, _adapting to changes_ and _new challenges_ along the way.
