# 🚀 Edge AI running in your browser

Think of SLMs as “cloud-only” systems: APIs, servers, tokens, latency, privacy trade-offs.

But what if none of that was necessary?

I built **INES - Intelligent Neural Edge System**, a full SLM-powered application that runs entirely inside the browser.

- No server.  
- No API key.  
- No data leaving your device.

---

## 🧠 What makes INES different?

INES runs a SML like **Gemma model** directly on-device using:

- Google’s **MediaPipe LLM Inference API**
- **WebGPU acceleration**
- WASM SIMD fallback when needed

The model is loaded once as a binary file and then everything happens locally in the tab.

After that moment → the browser becomes the AI runtime.

## ⚙️ One model → five AI systems

A single `LlmInference` instance powers five specialized tools:

- 💬 **Chat** → multi-turn assistant  
- ✉️ **Email** → rewrite, summarize, adjust tone  
- 🎙️ **Meeting** → speech → transcript → structured decisions  
- 🌍 **Translator** → offline, auto-detect, 10 languages  
- ✅ **Planner** → AI-generated daily task system  
- 👨‍💻 **Coding** → code generation + preview sandbox  
- 💬 **Learning** → Learning

Each tab injects its own system prompt — effectively turning one model into multiple agents.

---

## 🔒 Privacy by design (not policy)

- Prompts never leave the device  
- Meeting audio processed locally  
- Todo lists stored in `localStorage`  
- No analytics, no telemetry, no accounts  

This is what “local-first AI” actually looks like in practice.

## ⚡ Why Edge AI matters

This architecture enables use cases that cloud AI struggles with:

- 🔐 Corporate environments with strict data policies  
- 🌐 Offline or air-gapped systems  
- 📶 Low-connectivity regions  
- 🧪 Educational and demo environments  
- 🧍 Privacy-first personal tools  

Edge AI isn’t just about performance - it’s about **control shifting back to the user**.

## 🧩 The technical reality

Running an SLM in-browser is not trivial:

- WebGPU vs WASM fallback paths  
- Model loading as `ArrayBuffer` (not blob URLs)  
- Single shared inference runtime across UI modules  
- Streaming token generation in real time  
- Prompt orchestration per feature (chat/email/meeting/etc.)

But the result is simple:

> A complete AI workstation that runs inside a single HTML/SPA client.

## 💡Final thoughts

A new phase where “AI apps” won’t necessarily mean “cloud services”

- 🔐 **software that runs locally — and thinks locally**
